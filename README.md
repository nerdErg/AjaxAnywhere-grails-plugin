AjaxAnywhere-grails-plugin
==========================

This plugin integrates the [AjaxAnywhere (Reloaded)](http://ajaxanywhere.com) library seamlessly inside the Grails Framework ecosystem.

Essentially, this plugin registers the AjaxAnywhere filter to the host Grails application and a servlet to retrieve the AjaxAnywhere javascript file.
It also provides a TagLib a la Grails which is equivalent to the normal JSP TagLib that comes with the AjaxAnywhere Java library.
